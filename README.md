## Description
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

## Requirements
System requirements to run application

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## Teamwork

### Teamwork Planning
Maintain a complete overview of all the projects and resources by quantifying hours and accomplishments.

### Teamwork Files
Store project documents and templates for reusable documents, like Unit Tests.

### Teamwork Board
Visualize project development; how much has been done, what is being worked on and what comes next. 

The board is divided into a minimum of 3 columns: To-Dos, In Progress and Finished. 

Backlog is maintained by the Teamwork system itself so no column is necesarry.

Teamwork Tasks should be linked to the corresponding section in the Readme.

## Features
What makes your project stand out? 

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## How to use? / Quick Use Guide
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Design/Architecture/Framework (Development)

### Build status
Build shown by releases, updates, patches and future development plans.

### Diagram/Flowchart
Example

#### Module 1

#### API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

##### Description
Function of this module, what is its purpose.

##### Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

##### Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

| Test | Date | Description | Changes | Run Time | Issues | Possible Fixes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Test #1 | MM/DD/YYYY | Objective of the test | What changes have been implemented since the previous test | How long it took to run the test | Where did the test stop? Did it reach it's goal? | Brainstorm possible solutions |
